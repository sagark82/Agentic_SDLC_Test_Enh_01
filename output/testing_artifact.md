# Patient Enrollment System Integration - Test Strategy and Automation Scripts

## 1. Test Strategy

### 1.1. Introduction
This document outlines the test strategy for the Patient Enrollment System Integration project. The primary goal is to ensure that the integration between the Patient Enrollment Portal and the Healthcare Patient Database via the MuleSoft API is robust, secure, accurate, and meets all defined user stories and acceptance criteria.

### 1.2. Test Scope
The testing efforts will focus on the **Patient Enrollment API Application (MuleSoft)** and its interactions with connected systems.

**In-Scope:**
*   **Patient Enrollment API Functionality:** Verification of the `POST /patients/enroll` endpoint, including request reception, validation, data mapping, transformation, patient ID generation, and database insertion.
*   **API Security:** Authentication (JWT), authorization, HTTPS enforcement, and secure handling of credentials.
*   **Data Integrity:** Accurate mapping and transformation of patient data from the input payload to the target database schema. Uniqueness validation for `patient_id`.
*   **Error Handling:** Logging of failures, masking of sensitive data in logs, email notifications for critical issues, and appropriate error responses to the client.
*   **Database Interactions:** Successful connection to the Healthcare Patient DB, correct insertion of new records, and handling of database-related errors.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Verification that logs are generated correctly, contain necessary information, and sensitive data is masked.
*   **Email Notifications:** Confirmation that email alerts are sent to the IT Support Group upon critical failures with relevant details.
*   **API Contract Adherence:** Conformance of the implemented API to its RAML/OpenAPI specification.

**Out-of-Scope:**
*   The Patient Enrollment Portal's UI/UX and client-side logic.
*   Performance of the Healthcare Patient DB itself.
*   Infrastructure-level testing of CloudHub or the private healthcare cloud beyond verifying API deployment and connectivity.
*   Security penetration testing (though security features will be functionally tested).

### 1.3. Test Objectives
The key objectives of this testing strategy are to:
*   **Validate Functional Requirements:** Ensure all user stories and their acceptance criteria are fully met by the MuleSoft API.
*   **Ensure Data Accuracy and Integrity:** Verify that patient data is correctly mapped, transformed, and stored in the Healthcare Patient DB without corruption or loss.
*   **Guarantee System Security:** Confirm that all API interactions are secure (HTTPS, JWT), PHI is protected, and sensitive data is masked in logs.
*   **Verify Robust Error Handling:** Confirm that the system gracefully handles various failure scenarios, provides informative error messages, logs details, and notifies relevant stakeholders.
*   **Assess Performance and Scalability:** (Future phase, but considered in design) Ensure the API can handle expected load within acceptable response times.
*   **Confirm API Reliability and Stability:** Ensure the API operates consistently and reliably under various conditions.
*   **Verify Observability:** Ensure logging and monitoring mechanisms provide sufficient detail for troubleshooting and operational insights.

### 1.4. Test Phases and Types

The testing process will involve multiple phases and types of testing to ensure comprehensive coverage.

#### 1.4.1. Unit Testing
*   **Purpose:** To test individual components or modules in isolation.
*   **Focus:** DataWeave transformations, custom Java/Mule components, individual database connector operations, error handling flows.
*   **Approach:** Developers will write unit tests using MUnit for MuleSoft components and JUnit/Mockito for any custom Java code.

#### 1.4.2. Integration Testing
*   **Purpose:** To verify the interactions and data flow between different modules and external systems.
*   **Focus:**
    *   API Gateway to MuleSoft Application.
    *   MuleSoft Application to Healthcare Patient DB.
    *   MuleSoft Application to Secret Manager.
    *   MuleSoft Application to Logging Service.
    *   MuleSoft Application to Email Service.
*   **Approach:** Automated tests will simulate incoming requests and assert the outcomes of interactions with downstream systems (mocking external systems where necessary, but also full integration with test environments).

#### 1.4.3. API Functional Testing
*   **Purpose:** To validate the functionality of the `POST /patients/enroll` API endpoint against the defined requirements.
*   **Focus:**
    *   **Happy Path Scenarios:** Successful patient enrollment from end-to-end.
    *   **Negative Scenarios:**
        *   Invalid request payloads (missing mandatory fields, incorrect data types/formats).
        *   Duplicate `patient_id` during insertion.
        *   Database unavailability or connectivity issues.
        *   Partial data submission.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Maximum field lengths, special characters, boundary values for dates.
*   **Approach:** Automated tests using frameworks like Postman, Newman, or a dedicated API testing framework (e.g., RestAssured, Karate) to send requests and validate responses, database state, logs, and email notifications. This will be driven by the BDD feature file.

#### 1.4.4. Security Testing
*   **Purpose:** To ensure the API and data handling comply with security requirements and PHI protection.
*   **Focus:**
    *   **Authentication & Authorization (JWT):** Verify that only requests with valid and authorized JWT tokens are processed. Test with missing, invalid, expired, and unauthorized tokens.
    *   **Data in Transit Encryption (HTTPS):** Confirm that the API only accepts requests over HTTPS.
    *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Verify that database credentials are retrieved from a secure secret manager at runtime.
    *   **Sensitive Data Masking:** Validate that PHI (e.g., `insurance_id`) is masked in all system logs.
*   **Approach:** Automated API tests, potentially supplemented by manual security audits and vulnerability scanning tools.

#### 1.4.5. Error Handling Testing
*   **Purpose:** To validate the robustness and effectiveness of the error handling mechanisms.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Triggering various failure conditions (e.g., simulating DB downtime, invalid data leading to DB errors, network issues).
    *   Verifying log content: error messages, stack traces, masked PHI.
    *   Confirming email notifications are sent to the correct recipients with appropriate information.
    *   Validating the HTTP status codes and error messages returned to the client.
*   **Approach:** Automated tests that simulate failure conditions and assert the expected outcomes in logs, email, and API responses.

#### 1.4.6. Performance Testing (Future Phase)
*   **Purpose:** To assess the API's responsiveness, throughput, and stability under various load conditions.
*   **Focus:** API response times, resource utilization (CPU, memory), and error rates under concurrent user loads.
*   **Approach:** Using tools like JMeter or LoadRunner to simulate high volumes of concurrent patient enrollment requests.

#### 1.4.7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
*   **Purpose:** To ensure the system meets the business needs and is acceptable to end-users/stakeholders.
*   **Focus:** End-to-end verification by business users of the patient enrollment process.
*   **Approach:** Manual testing performed by business representatives using a dedicated UAT environment.

### 1.5. Test Environment
*   **Development Environment:** For unit testing and initial integration testing.
*   **Integration/QA Environment:** A dedicated environment mirroring production as closely as possible, used for comprehensive integration, functional, and security testing.
*   **UAT Environment:** A stable environment for business users to conduct acceptance testing.
*   **Production Environment:** The live system, subject to post-deployment verification.

### 1.6. Test Data Management
*   **Creation:** Test data will be generated to cover various scenarios (valid, invalid, edge cases).
*   **Masking:** Production-like data will be used, with sensitive information appropriately masked or anonymized for non-production environments.
*   **Reset:** Mechanisms will be in place to reset the test database to a known state before each test run, especially for automated tests.

### 1.7. Automation Strategy
*   Prioritize API functional tests, integration tests, and security validation tests for automation.
*   Utilize a BDD framework (e.g., Cucumber with Java/JavaScript) to implement automated tests based on the Gherkin feature files.
*   Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation.
*   Leverage MUnit for MuleSoft unit testing.

### 1.8. Roles and Responsibilities
*   **QA Lead/Automation Engineer:** Develop test strategy, create test plans, design test cases, oversee automation, manage test data, report on test progress.
*   **Developers:** Write unit tests, assist with integration testing, resolve defects.
*   **Business Analysts/Product Owners:** Provide clarity on requirements, participate in UAT.
*   **IT Support Group:** Review error notification content.

### 1.9. Defect Management
*   All defects will be logged in a defect tracking system (e.g., JIRA).
*   Defects will be prioritized based on severity and impact.
*   A clear defect lifecycle will be followed (New, Open, In Progress, Re-test, Closed).

## 2. BDD Feature File

Feature: Patient Enrollment System Integration

  As a Patient Enrollment System
  I want to securely and accurately enroll new patients
  So that patient data is captured efficiently and protected.

  Background:
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is available at "https://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    And a secure HTTPS connection is established
    And a valid JWT token is provided for authentication and authorization
    And the Healthcare Patient Database is accessible

  Scenario Outline: Successful Patient Enrollment and Record Creation
    Given a new patient enrollment form is successfully submitted through the Patient Enrollment Portal
    When the submission is complete and validated by the API Gateway
    Then the API endpoint for patient registration is invoked automatically
    And a unique patient_id is system-generated by the API
    And the patient data is correctly mapped and transformed from the input payload to the target database schema as follows:
      | Input Field           | Database Column   |
      | patientFullName       | patient_name      |
      | dateOfBirth           | dob               |
      | gender                | gender            |
      | address               | address_line1     |
      | city                  | city              |
      | stateRegion           | state             |
      | postalCode            | postal_code       |
      | phoneNumber           | contact_phone     |
      | insurancePolicyNumber | insurance_id      |
    And a new record is successfully created in the `Patients` table with the mapped data
    And the database insertion utilizes securely stored database credentials
    And the response status is 201 Created
    And the response body contains "Patient enrolled successfully." and the generated patientId

    Examples:
      | patientFullName | dateOfBirth | gender   | address         | city        | stateRegion | postalCode | phoneNumber    | insurancePolicyNumber |
      | John Doe        | 1990-01-15  | Male     | 123 Main St     | Anytown     | CA          | 90210      | +15551234567   | ABC123456789          |
      | Jane Smith      | 1988-03-22  | Female   | 789 Pine Ln     | Otherville  | NY          | 10001      | +15559876543   | DEF987654321          |
      | Alex Johnson    | 1975-11-05  | Non-binary | 321 Elm Rd      | Metroburg   | TX          | 77001      | +15551112222   | GHI112233445          |

  Scenario: Request Payload Validation Failure (Missing Mandatory Field)
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is available at "https://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    And a secure HTTPS connection is established
    And a valid JWT token is provided for authentication and authorization
    When a patient enrollment request is submitted with missing mandatory fields:
      | Field                 | Value         |
      | patientFullName       | John Doe      |
      | dateOfBirth           | 1990-01-15    |
      | gender                | Male          |
      | address               | 123 Main St   |
      | city                  | Anytown       |
      | stateRegion           | CA            |
      | postalCode            | 90210         |
      | phoneNumber           | +15551234567  |
      | insurancePolicyNumber |               |
    Then the API returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request status
    And the response body contains error details indicating "insurancePolicyNumber is required"
    And no patient record is created in the `Patients` table
    And the invalid request details are logged

  Scenario: Request Payload Validation Failure (Incorrect Data Type)
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is available at "https://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    And a secure HTTPS connection is established
    And a valid JWT token is provided for authentication and authorization
    When a patient enrollment request is submitted with an incorrect data type for "dateOfBirth":
      | Field                 | Value         |
      | patientFullName       | John Doe      |
      | dateOfBirth           | Not-A-Date    |
      | gender                | Male          |
      | address               | 123 Main St   |
      | city                  | Anytown       |
      | stateRegion           | CA            |
      | postalCode            | 90210         |
      | phoneNumber           | +15551234567  |
      | insurancePolicyNumber | ABC123456789  |
    Then the API returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request status
    And the response body contains error details indicating "dateOfBirth must be in YYYY-MM-DD format"
    And no patient record is created in the `Patients` table
    And the invalid request details are logged

  Scenario: Unauthorized API Access (Missing JWT)
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is available at "https://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    And a secure HTTPS connection is established
    When a patient enrollment request is submitted without a JWT token
    Then the API returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized status
    And no patient record is created in the `Patients` table
    And the access attempt is logged

  Scenario: Unauthorized API Access (Invalid JWT)
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is available at "https://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    And a secure HTTPS connection is established
    When a patient enrollment request is submitted with an invalid JWT token
    Then the API returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized status
    And no patient record is created in the `Patients` table
    And the access attempt is logged

  Scenario: Insecure API Access (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is configured to only accept HTTPS connections
    When a patient enrollment request is submitted over HTTP to "http://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    Then the connection is rejected or redirected to HTTPS
    And no patient record is created in the `Patients` table
    And an appropriate error message is returned (e.g., "HTTPS required")

  Scenario: Database Insertion Failure Triggers Error Handling and Notification
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is available at "https://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    And a valid JWT token is provided
    And the Healthcare Patient DB is temporarily unavailable or experiences an insertion error
    When a new patient enrollment form is submitted
    Then the API returns an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error status
    And the failure is logged with a detailed error message, the specific reason for failure, and relevant patient data (with sensitive fields masked)
    And an email notification is sent to the configured Healthcare IT support group
    And the email notification contains sufficient information to identify the failed transaction and the root cause of the error
    And no new patient record is created in the `Patients` table

  Scenario: Duplicate Patient ID Uniqueness Check Failure
    Given the Patient Enrollment API is available at "https://api.healthcare.com/patients/enroll"
    And a valid JWT token is provided
    And a patient record with a specific system-generated `patient_id` (e.g., "PAT-20230001") already exists in the `Patients` table
    When a new patient enrollment form is submitted that would result in the same system-generated `patient_id`
    Then the API returns an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error status
    And the failure is logged with a detailed error message indicating "Duplicate patient ID: PAT-20230001" (with sensitive fields masked)
    And an email notification is sent to the configured Healthcare IT support group
    And no new patient record is created with the duplicate `patient_id`

  Scenario: Sensitive Data Masking in Logs
    Given a patient enrollment request containing sensitive data is processed
    When the system logs details of the transaction (success or failure)
    Then the `insurance_id` field is masked in all system logs
    And any other Protected Health Information (PHI) is masked in the logs
