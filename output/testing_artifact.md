## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Patient Enrollment Portal project. Its purpose is to define the scope, objectives, methodologies, and resources required to ensure the application meets the specified functional and non-functional requirements, delivering a high-quality, secure, and reliable product.

### 1.2. Project Overview
The Patient Enrollment Portal is a web application designed to streamline the patient enrollment process. It allows users to find information, register for an account, submit personal and medical details, upload documents, and track their application status. It also provides a backend interface for providers and administrators to manage and review these applications. The system prioritizes security, data privacy (HIPAA, GDPR/CCPA), performance, and accessibility.

## 2. Scope of Testing

### 2.1. In Scope
The following features and aspects of the application are in scope for testing:

*   **Functional Testing:**
    *   **Informational Pages & Support:** Home, FAQ, Search, Contact Us, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service pages.
    *   **Patient Registration & Onboarding:** Account creation, email/SMS verification, multi-step enrollment form, and digital consent.
    *   **Document Management:** Secure file upload (validation of type/size), viewing, and deletion.
    *   **Patient Dashboard & Communication:** Application status tracking and secure messaging.
    *   **Provider/Admin Workflow:** Admin dashboard, application filtering/sorting, and application review/decision (approve/reject).
*   **API Testing:** End-to-end testing of all RESTful API endpoints defined in the High-Level Design (HLD), including authentication, authorization (RBAC), data validation, and error handling.
*   **Non-Functional Testing:**
    *   **UI/UX & Responsiveness:** Verification of layout and functionality across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.
    *   **Performance Testing:** Page load times (LCP) and API response times under normal and peak load conditions.
    *   **Security Testing:** Verification of security controls including HTTPS, data encryption, role-based access, and checks for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
    *   **Accessibility Testing:** Compliance with WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards.
    *   **Compliance Testing:** Verification of features supporting GDPR/CCPA (data export, data deletion) and HIPAA guidelines.
*   **Cross-Browser Testing:** Testing on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### 2.2. Out of Scope
*   Testing of third-party services (e.g., Email/SMS provider uptime, S3 object store infrastructure). We will only test the integration points.
*   Underlying cloud infrastructure and network hardware testing.
*   Live production environment performance/stress testing without explicit approval.
*   Usability testing with a formal focus group (though UI/UX feedback will be provided).

## 4. Testing Types & Levels

| Testing Level      | Approach                                                                                                                                                                                            | Owner       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Unit Testing**   | Developers will write unit tests for individual functions and components in the FastAPI backend using `pytest`. Focus is on business logic in isolation.                                              | Developer   |
| **Integration Testing** | Testing the interaction between different API modules, the database, and the object store. For example, verifying that a successful document upload API call correctly updates the database.           | Developer/QA |
| **API Testing**    | A dedicated suite of automated tests will target the RESTful API endpoints directly. This will cover contract testing, validation, error responses, and security checks (RBAC).                       | QA Engineer |
| **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** | UI-driven automated tests that simulate complete user journeys based on the BDD scenarios. Examples: full patient registration to submission, provider review to approval.                     | QA Engineer |
| **UI & Responsiveness** | A combination of automated visual regression testing and manual checks across defined browser/device combinations to ensure a consistent and functional user experience.                           | QA Engineer |
| **Security Testing** | Manual and automated checks for security vulnerabilities. Includes verifying authentication/authorization logic, data encryption, and secure handling of sensitive information.                        | QA Engineer |
| **Performance Testing** | Load and stress testing on the API endpoints in a staging environment to measure response times, throughput, and system stability under load. Frontend performance metrics will be captured.        | QA Engineer |
| **Accessibility Testing** | Automated scans using tools like Axe-core integrated into the E2E suite, followed by manual testing for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.                               | QA Engineer |
| **User Acceptance (UAT)** | The Product Owner and key stakeholders will perform testing in the staging environment to validate that the application meets business requirements before release.                                | Product Owner |

## 5. Test Automation Approach

### 5.1. Framework & Tools

| Area                | Tool / Framework                                   | Purpose                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BDD / E2E Testing** | `Python` with `Playwright` and `pytest-bdd`        | For implementing Gherkin feature files to drive UI-based E2E tests in a readable and collaborative format. |
| **API Testing**     | `Python` with `pytest` and `httpx`                 | For creating a fast, reliable, and maintainable suite of tests for the FastAPI backend.                 |
| **Performance Testing** | `k6` (Grafana k6)                                  | For scripting realistic load tests to measure API performance and reliability.                          |
| **Accessibility Testing** | `Axe-core` (via Playwright integration)            | To run automated accessibility audits within the E2E test suite.                                        |
| **CI/CD**           | GitHub Actions / Jenkins                           | To automatically run the test suites (API, E2E) on every commit or pull request to the main branches.     |
| **Defect Tracking** | Jira                                               | To log, track, and manage all identified defects through their lifecycle.                               |

### 5.2. Automation Strategy
*   **Test Pyramid Model:** We will follow the test pyramid principle, with a large base of fast unit tests, a smaller layer of integration/API tests, and a very selective set of UI E2E tests.
*   **API-First Automation:** The majority of functional and regression testing will be performed at the API level. This is faster, more stable, and allows for earlier detection of bugs in the development cycle.
*   **UI Automation for Key Journeys:** UI E2E tests will be reserved for validating critical user workflows, such as the complete patient enrollment process and the provider's application review process.
*   **Continuous Integration:** All automated tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to provide rapid feedback to the development team. Builds will fail if critical tests do not pass.
