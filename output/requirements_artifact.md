## User Stories for Patient Enrollment Data Processing

### US-001: Secure Patient Enrollment Data Ingestion

**As** the Patient Enrollment Portal,
**I want** to securely submit new patient enrollment forms to the healthcare system,
**So that** patient data can be automatically processed and stored without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC-1: Automatic Trigger**
    *   **Given** a new Patient Enrollment Form is successfully submitted through the portal,
    *   **When** the submission is complete,
    *   **Then** the Patient Enrollment API endpoint is automatically invoked.
*   **AC-2: API Endpoint Availability**
    *   **Given** the Patient Enrollment Portal attempts to submit a form,
    *   **When** it connects to the API,
    *   **Then** the API is accessible via an HTTPS endpoint.
*   **AC-3: API Authentication**
    *   **Given** the Patient Enrollment Portal invokes the API,
    *   **When** the API receives the request,
    *   **Then** the API validates the provided JWT token for authentication.
    *   **And** the API rejects requests with invalid or missing JWT tokens.
*   **AC-4: Data Encryption in Transit**
    *   **Given** the API receives a request containing Protected Health Information (PHI),
    *   **When** the data is transmitted from the portal to the API,
    *   **Then** all PHI data is encrypted during transit using HTTPS.
*   **AC-5: Payload Validation**
    *   **Given** the API receives a request with patient enrollment data,
    *   **When** the request payload is validated against the defined API schema (e.g., RAML/OpenAPI),
    *   **Then** the API rejects requests with invalid data formats or missing required fields.
*   **AC-6: Successful Data Extraction**
    *   **Given** a valid and authenticated request is received by the API,
    *   **When** the API successfully validates the payload,
    *   **Then** the API extracts the patient enrollment data for subsequent processing.

### US-002: Patient Data Transformation and Mapping

**As** the Patient Enrollment System,
**I want** to accurately map and transform submitted patient enrollment form fields to the `Patients` table schema,
**So that** the data is correctly structured for storage in the healthcare database.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC-1: Patient Full Name Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'Patient Full Name' field is mapped to the `patient_name` column.
*   **AC-2: System-Generated Patient ID**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** a unique 'Patient ID' is system-generated and mapped to the `patient_id` column.
*   **AC-3: Date of Birth Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'Date of Birth' field is mapped to the `dob` column.
*   **AC-4: Gender Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,

    *   **Then** the 'Gender' field is mapped to the `gender` column.
*   **AC-5: Address Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'Address' field is mapped to the `address_line1` column.
*   **AC-6: City Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'City' field is mapped to the `city` column.
*   **AC-7: State/Region Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'State/Region' field is mapped to the `state` column.
*   **AC-8: Postal Code Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'Postal Code' field is mapped to the `postal_code` column.
*   **AC-9: Phone Number Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'Phone Number' field is mapped to the `contact_phone` column.
*   **AC-10: Insurance Policy Number Mapping**
    *   **Given** patient enrollment data is received from the portal,
    *   **When** the system processes the data,
    *   **Then** the 'Insurance Policy Number' field is mapped to the `insurance_id` column.
*   **AC-11: Schema Conformance**
    *   **Given** all required fields are mapped,
    *   **When** the data transformation is complete,
    *   **Then** the transformed data conforms precisely to the `Patients` table schema.

### US-003: New Patient Record Creation

**As** the Patient Enrollment System,
**I want** to insert new, transformed patient records into the Healthcare Patient Database,
**So that** patient information is persistently stored and accessible for healthcare operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC-1: Successful Record Insertion**
    *   **Given** patient data has been successfully mapped and transformed,
    *   **When** the system attempts to store the data,
    *   **Then** a new record containing all mapped data is successfully inserted into the `Patients` table in the Healthcare Patient DB.
*   **AC-2: Database Connection Security**
    *   **Given** the system connects to the Healthcare Patient DB,
    *   **When** it authenticates,
    *   **Then** database credentials are securely retrieved from a secure store (e.g., Vault, encrypted properties) and used for authentication.
*   **AC-3: Confirmation of Insertion**
    *   **Given** a record insertion is successful,
    *   **When** the database operation completes,
    *   **Then** the system receives confirmation that the record has been added to the `Patients` table.

### US-004: Database Insertion Failure Notification

**As** the Patient Enrollment System,
**I want** to log and notify the Healthcare IT support group via email if a patient record insertion fails,
**So that** issues can be promptly identified and resolved, minimizing data loss or processing delays.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC-1: Failure Logging**
    *   **Given** an attempt to insert a new patient record fails for any reason (e.g., database unavailable, data validation error, duplicate patient ID),
    *   **When** the failure occurs,
    *   **Then** the system logs the error details, including a unique transaction ID, timestamp, error type, and relevant (non-PHI) context.
*   **AC-2: Email Notification Trigger**
    *   **Given** a database insertion failure is detected,
    *   **When** the error is processed by the global error handler,
    *   **Then** an email notification is automatically sent to the configured Healthcare IT support group.
*   **AC-3: Email Content for IT Support**
    *   **Given** an email notification is sent to the IT support group,
    *   **When** the IT support group receives it,
    *   **Then** the email contains sufficient details to identify the nature of the failure (e.g., type of error, affected patient ID if available and non-sensitive, timestamp, system component involved).
    *   **And** the email does *not* contain unmasked sensitive patient data (PHI).
*   **AC-4: Handling Specific Failure Types**
    *   **Given** an insertion fails due to a duplicate patient ID,
    *   **When** the error handler processes it,
    *   **Then** the log entry and email notification clearly indicate a "Duplicate Patient ID" error.
    *   **Given** an insertion fails due to a database being unavailable,
    *   **When** the error handler processes it,
    *   **Then** the log entry and email notification clearly indicate a "Database Unavailable" error.

### US-005: Sensitive Data Masking in Logs

**As** the Patient Enrollment System,
**I want** to mask sensitive patient information in all system logs,
**So that** Protected Health Information (PHI) is not exposed in system logs and compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA) are met.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC-1: Identification of Sensitive Fields**
    *   **Given** any log entry is generated by the system,
    *   **When** the log entry contains data from fields identified as sensitive (e.g., Insurance Policy Number, SSN if applicable),
    *   **Then** these specific fields are identified for masking.
*   **AC-2: Masking Format**
    *   **Given** a sensitive data field is identified in a log entry,
    *   **When** the log entry is written,
    *   **Then** the sensitive data is replaced with a masking pattern (e.g., `********` or only the last 4 digits visible with the rest masked).
*   **AC-3: PHI Protection in Logs**
    *   **Given** an authorized user reviews system logs,
    *   **When** log entries containing PHI are examined,
    *   **Then** the masked data prevents direct identification of the patient from the log content alone.
