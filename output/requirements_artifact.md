## Story 12: BDD Feature File Generation

*   **As a test engineer or admin,** I want the system to generate BDD feature files in Gherkin format based on defined use cases, **so that** I can automate testing and ensure system behavior meets requirements efficiently.

    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   **Given** I am logged in as an authorized user (e.g., Admin or Test Engineer role), **when** I select a predefined use case (e.g., "Patient Registration"), **then** the system should generate a Gherkin feature file template.
        *   **Given** I select a use case, **when** the feature file is generated, **then** it should include `Feature:` and `Scenario:` outlines for common flows related to that use case (e.g., for Patient Registration: "Successful Registration," "Registration with Existing Email," "Invalid Input").
        *   **Given** the system generates a feature file, **then** it should be downloadable in a standard text format (.feature).
        *   **Given** the system generates a feature file for a use case like "Document Upload," **then** it should include scenarios such as "Successful Document Upload," "Upload Invalid File Type," "Exceed File Size Limit."
