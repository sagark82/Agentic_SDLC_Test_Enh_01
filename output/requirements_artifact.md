### User Story 3: Create New Patient Record in Database

*   **As the:** healthcare system
*   **I want to:** create a new patient record in the Patient Management Database
*   **So that:** the patient's information is securely stored and accessible for healthcare operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC1: Successful Record Insertion**
    *   **GIVEN** successfully mapped and validated patient enrollment data,
    *   **WHEN** the system attempts to insert this data,
    *   **THEN** a new record must be successfully inserted into the 'Patients' table of the target Healthcare Patient DB.
*   **AC2: Data Integrity**
    *   **GIVEN** a new record is created in the 'Patients' table,
    *   **WHEN** the insertion is complete,
    *   **THEN** all mapped fields (`patient_name`, `patient_id`, `dob`, `gender`, `address_line1`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, `contact_phone`, `insurance_id`) must be accurately populated.
*   **AC3: Secure Database Connection**
    *   **GIVEN** the system needs to connect to the Patient Management Database,
    *   **WHEN** establishing the connection and performing insertions,
    *   **THEN** it must use a secure database connector with credentials securely stored.

### User Story 4: Handle Database Insertion Failures and Notify IT Support

*   **As the:** healthcare system
*   **I want to:** detect and log any failures during the patient record creation process and notify IT support
*   **So that:** issues can be promptly addressed, data integrity maintained, and system stability ensured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC1: Failure Logging**
    *   **GIVEN** an attempt to insert a new patient record into the database,
    *   **WHEN** the database insertion fails for any reason (e.g., database unavailable, network error, data validation error, duplicate patient ID),
    *   **THEN** the failure must be logged with sufficient detail to diagnose the issue.
*   **AC2: Email Notification to IT Support**
    *   **GIVEN** a database insertion failure occurs and is logged,
    *   **WHEN** the failure is detected,
    *   **THEN** an email notification must be sent to the designated Healthcare IT support group.

### User Story 6: Mask Sensitive Data in System Logs

*   **As the:** healthcare system
*   **I want to:** mask sensitive patient information (e.g., Insurance ID) in system logs
*   **So that:** patient privacy is maintained even in operational monitoring and auditing, complying with data protection regulations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **AC1: Insurance ID Masking**
    *   **GIVEN** any logging event that includes patient data,
    *   **WHEN** the system writes the `insurance_id` (Insurance Policy Number) to logs,
    *   **THEN** the `insurance_id` must be masked (e.g., showing only the last 4 digits or fully obfuscated).
*   **AC2: General PHI Masking**
    *   **GIVEN** any other field identified as sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI) is present in log entries,
    *   **WHEN** the system writes to logs,
    *   **THEN** that PHI field must also be masked according to defined privacy policies.
*   **AC3: Irreversibility of Masked Data**
    *   **GIVEN** a masked sensitive data entry in the logs,
    *   **WHEN** an authorized user views the logs,
    *   **THEN** the masked data should not be easily reversible to its original form without additional, highly secured access mechanisms.
