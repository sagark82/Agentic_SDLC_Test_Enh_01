# User Stories for Patient Enrollment Process

Here are the detailed user stories with acceptance criteria based on the provided high-level requirements:

---

## User Story 1: Patient Enrollment Submission API

*   **As** the Patient Enrollment Portal,
*   **I want to** submit new patient enrollment forms via a secure API endpoint,
*   **So that** new patient records can be automatically created in the healthcare database.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   GIVEN a new patient enrollment form is successfully submitted by the Patient Enrollment Portal
*   WHEN the portal sends the enrollment data to the API endpoint
*   THEN the API endpoint must receive the request via HTTPS.
*   AND the API must validate the incoming request payload against the defined API specification (e.g., RAML/OpenAPI).
*   AND the API must validate the JWT token provided in the request header for authentication and authorization.
*   AND the API must decrypt any encrypted Protected Health Information (PHI) fields in the payload for internal processing.
*   AND the API must return a success response (e.g., HTTP 202 Accepted) if the request is valid and accepted for processing.
*   AND the API must return an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden) if the request is invalid, unauthorized, or malformed.

## User Story 2: New Patient Record Creation

*   **As** the Healthcare Patient Management System,
*   **I want to** accurately map and insert new patient enrollment data into the Patients table,
*   **So that** a complete and correct patient record is created.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   GIVEN a valid and authenticated new patient enrollment request has been successfully received by the API
*   WHEN the system processes the enrollment data
*   THEN the system must generate a unique `patient_id` for the new patient.
*   AND the system must accurately map the following fields from the enrollment form to the `Patients` table:
    *   Patient Full Name → `patient_name`
    *   System-generated Patient ID → `patient_id`
    *   Date of Birth → `dob`
    *   Gender → `gender`
    *   Address → `address_line1`
    *   City → `city`
    *   State/Region → `state`
    *   Postal Code → `postal_code`
    *   Phone Number → `contact_phone`
    *   Insurance Policy Number → `insurance_id`
*   AND the system must successfully insert a new record with the mapped data into the `Patients` table in the target database.
*   AND the system must use securely stored database credentials for the insertion operation.
*   AND the system must ensure data validation rules for the `Patients` table are met before insertion (e.g., `dob` is a valid date, `gender` adheres to defined values).

## User Story 3: Failed Patient Record Creation Notification

*   **As** the Healthcare Patient Management System,
*   **I want to** log failed patient record insertions and notify IT support,
*   **So that** operational issues can be promptly identified and resolved.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   GIVEN the system attempts to insert a new patient record into the database
*   WHEN the database insertion fails for any reason (e.g., database unavailability, data validation error, duplicate system-generated patient ID, network issue, constraint violation)
*   THEN the system must log the failure event with relevant error details (e.g., timestamp, error message, attempted data excluding sensitive fields).
*   AND the system must send an email notification to the designated Healthcare IT support group.
*   AND the email notification must contain sufficient information to identify the failed transaction and the reason for failure.
*   AND sensitive patient data (e.g., Insurance Policy Number, full patient name) must NOT be included in the email notification body or subject.
*   AND the system must utilize a global error handler to catch and manage such exceptions consistently.

## User Story 4: Secure Data Handling for Patient Enrollment

*   **As** the Healthcare Patient Management System,
*   **I want to** secure patient enrollment data during transmission and processing,
*   **So that** Protected Health Information (PHI) is safeguarded according to compliance standards.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   GIVEN patient enrollment data contains PHI (e.g., patient name, DOB, address, insurance ID)
*   WHEN the data is transmitted from the Patient Enrollment Portal to the API
*   THEN all communication must occur over HTTPS with strong encryption.
*   AND specific PHI fields within the payload must be encrypted by the source system before transmission.
*   AND the API must validate the JWT token provided in the request header for every incoming request.
*   AND database credentials used for patient record insertion must be securely stored (e.g., in a secret manager or vault, not hardcoded or in plain text configuration files).
*   AND the system must ensure that decrypted PHI is only handled in memory for the shortest necessary duration and never persisted in an unencrypted state outside the secure database.

## User Story 5: Audit Logging for Patient Enrollment Process

*   **As** the Healthcare Patient Management System,
*   **I want to** log events related to patient enrollment processing,
*   **So that** system activities can be audited and sensitive data remains protected in logs.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   GIVEN the patient enrollment process is executed
*   WHEN the system logs events (e.g., API request received, data transformation, database insertion attempt, success/failure)
*   THEN the system must mask or redact sensitive data (e.g., Insurance Policy Number, SSN if present, full patient name, complete address) from all log entries.
*   AND log entries must include essential contextual information such as a timestamp, event type, and a correlation ID for traceability.
*   AND logs must be stored in a secure, centralized, and auditable logging system with appropriate access controls.
*   AND the system must implement a consistent logging standard and format across the entire integration component.
