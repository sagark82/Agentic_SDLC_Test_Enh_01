# User Stories for Patient Enrollment Process

---

## User Story 1: Patient Enrollment Process Trigger

*   **As a:** Patient Enrollment System
*   **I want to:** automatically trigger the patient registration process upon successful form submission
*   **So that:** new patient data is captured efficiently without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   **GIVEN** a new patient enrollment form is successfully submitted through the Patient Enrollment Portal.
*   **WHEN** the submission is complete and validated by the portal.
*   **THEN** the API endpoint for patient registration must be invoked automatically.
*   The API invocation must occur over a secure HTTPS connection.
*   The API request payload must contain all necessary patient enrollment data from the submitted form.

## User Story 2: Patient Data Mapping and Transformation

*   **As a:** Patient Registration System
*   **I want to:** accurately map and transform patient data from the enrollment form payload to the healthcare database schema
*   **So that:** the information is correctly structured for storage and future use.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   **GIVEN** a valid patient enrollment request payload is received by the API.
*   **WHEN** the system processes the payload.
*   **THEN** the following fields must be mapped and transformed from the input payload to the target database schema:
    *   `Patient Full Name` → `patient_name`
    *   `Date of Birth` → `dob`
    *   `Gender` → `gender`
    *   `Address` → `address_line1`
    *   `City` → `city`
    *   `State/Region` → `state`
    *   `Postal Code` → `postal_code`
    *   `Phone Number` → `contact_phone`
    *   `Insurance Policy Number` → `insurance_id`
*   The `patient_id` must be system-generated by the API (if not provided by the source) and ensured to be unique.
*   The data transformation logic must be implemented using DataWeave (or equivalent integration platform's transformation capabilities).

## User Story 3: New Patient Record Creation

*   **As a:** Patient Registration System
*   **I want to:** insert new, mapped patient data into the Patients table in the healthcare database
*   **So that:** a permanent and accessible record for the new patient is successfully established.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   **GIVEN** patient data has been successfully mapped and transformed according to the target database schema.
*   **WHEN** the system attempts to insert this data into the Healthcare Patient DB.
*   **THEN** a new record must be successfully created in the `Patients` table with the mapped data.
*   The database insertion must utilize securely stored database credentials.
*   The database connector must successfully connect to the target Healthcare Patient DB (e.g., PostgreSQL / Oracle).
*   The system must validate the uniqueness of the `patient_id` before insertion.

## User Story 4: Error Handling and Notification for Failed Patient Record Insertion

*   **As a:** Healthcare IT Support Group
*   **I want to:** be immediately notified and have details logged when a patient record insertion fails
*   **So that:** I can investigate and resolve database issues promptly, ensuring data integrity and preventing data loss.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   **GIVEN** the system attempts to insert a new patient record into the database.
*   **WHEN** the database insertion fails for any reason (e.g., database unavailability, data validation error, duplicate patient ID, network connectivity issue).
*   **THEN** the failure must be logged with a detailed error message, the specific reason for failure, and relevant patient data (with sensitive fields masked).
*   **AND** an email notification must be sent to the configured Healthcare IT support group.
*   The email notification must contain sufficient information to identify the failed transaction, the patient (non-sensitive identifiers), and the root cause of the error.
*   The logging mechanism must mask sensitive data such as `insurance_id` (and any other PHI like SSN if it were present) in the logs.
*   The system must utilize a global error handler to manage these failure scenarios.

## User Story 5: API Security and Data Protection

*   **As a:** Patient Enrollment System Administrator
*   **I want to:** ensure all API interactions and patient data are secure and protected
*   **So that:** patient privacy (PHI) is maintained, and unauthorized access is prevented, complying with healthcare regulations.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   All API calls to the patient enrollment endpoint must be validated using JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.
*   All Protected Health Information (PHI) within the API request and response payloads must be encrypted during transit (e.g., via HTTPS).
*   Database credentials used for connecting to the Healthcare Patient DB must be stored securely (e.g., in a secret manager or encrypted properties).
*   Sensitive data (e.g., `insurance_id`, `SSN` if applicable) must be masked in all system logs to prevent accidental exposure.
*   The API must be deployed on CloudHub or the hospital’s private cloud with appropriate network and platform-level security configurations.

## User Story 6: API Endpoint Definition and Request Validation

*   **As a:** Patient Enrollment Portal Developer
*   **I want to:** have a clearly defined and validated API endpoint for submitting patient enrollment data
*   **So that:** I can reliably integrate the portal with the patient management system and ensure data quality.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   A REST API endpoint must be exposed via HTTPS for receiving patient enrollment form submissions.
*   The API specification (RAML/OpenAPI) must be available, up-to-date, and accurately define the endpoint, expected request payload schema, and response structures.
*   The API must perform initial validation of the incoming request payload (e.g., checking for mandatory fields, correct data types, valid formats) at the API gateway level.
*   Invalid requests must receive appropriate and informative error responses (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) with details on validation failures.
