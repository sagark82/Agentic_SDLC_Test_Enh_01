*   **Given** a feature file has been generated for patient registration,
    **When** I open the file,
    **Then** it should contain Gherkin scenarios in a `Given-When-Then` format, such as "Successful patient registration with email verification."
*   **Given** a feature file has been generated for provider approval,
    **When** I open the file,
    **Then** it should contain scenarios like "Provider approves a submitted application" and "Provider rejects an application with a reason."
